=========================== ABOUT ==========================
The 'binarytree' package provides an easy but flexible way
to draw binary trees using TikZ. It provides a macro
\BinaryTree which takes two arguments: a path specification
and a number indicating the maximum depth of the tree. The
path specification and the setting of various options
determine the style for each edge of the tree. The options
can be set either by passing them as an optional argument to
\BinaryTree, or by calling \btreeset.

There is support for the external library of TikZ which does
not affect externalization of the rest of the TikZ figures
in the document (externalization is enabled locally for each
\BinaryTree). There is an option to use automatic file
naming: this is useful if the trees are often moved around
or new ones are added in between, in which case using the
default naming will cause all of them to be rebuilt.
Instead, giving a unique name to each tree will have TikZ
use the already compiled image no matter where in the
document it is or how many times it has been used. This
feature is still in its very infancy and more control over
how the file name is generated is planned for the future.

======================= INSTALLATION =======================
Extract all of the files and run latex on binarytree.ins:
  latex binarytree.ins

Move the generated binarytree.sty into a TeX searchable
directory, for example on Linux:
  mkdir -p <TeX folder>/tex/latex/binarytree
  mv binarytree.sty <TeX folder>/tex/latex/binarytree
The local user TeX directory is in
'C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\texmf' on Windows,
'~/texmf' on Linux or '~/Library/texmf' on OS X.

If you wish to (re)create the documentation:
  pdflatex binarytree.dtx
  pdflatex binarytree.dtx
  makeindex -s gglo.ist -o binarytree.gls binarytree.glo
  makeindex -s gind.ist -o binarytree.ind binarytree.idx
  pdflatex binarytree.dtx
  pdflatex binarytree.dtx

========================== TESTING =========================
Provided are four files to test the package (also included
as examples in the documentation:
* 'examples/binarytree-ex1.tex' draws two trees, names them
  as nodes and uses them in a simple graph. To recompile it,
  simply run:
    pdflatex examples/binarytree-ex1.tex
* 'examples/binarytree-ex2.tex' draws 4 identically
  structured trees using different level and sibling
  distance scalings. To recompile it, simply run:
    pdflatex examples/binarytree-ex2.tex
* 'examples/binarytree-ex3.tex' draws a square with arrows
  on each side! To recompile it, simply run:
    pdflatex examples/binarytree-ex3.tex
* 'examples/binarytree-ex4.tex' draws a similar square twice
  and exports them using the external library. It uses the
  'list and make' mode, so it generates
  'examples/binarytree-ex4.figlist' and
  'examples/binarytree-ex4.makefile', requiring manual
  compilation of the exported figure:
    pdflatex examples/binarytree-ex4.tex
    make -f examples/binarytree-ex4.makefile
    pdflatex examples/binarytree-ex4.tex
