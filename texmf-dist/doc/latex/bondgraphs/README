The bondgraphs package allows for easy and neat bondgraph drawing in LaTeX. Its core is a set of TikZ style definitions. It uses some of the last TikZ features, so a recent version of pgf is required (>=3.0). This version is shipped in most 2014 LaTeX version; you can check your version by typesetting a document that contains \pgfversion.
This ma足te足rial is sub足ject to the LATEX Project Public Li足cense.

The documentation and sty can be generated manually, by running tex on bondgraphs.ins and (pdf)latex on bondgraphs.dtx, or making use of the supplied Makefile.
