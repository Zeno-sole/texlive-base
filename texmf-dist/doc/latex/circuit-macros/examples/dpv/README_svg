  Many circuit diagrams do not contain sophisticated text formatting so
  the sources in this directory might serve as useful examples.  Some of
  the diagrams contain no text at all but do contain many elements and
  may exceed LaTeX memory.

  Type "make" in this directory to generate examplesDPV.html.  The diagram
  sources have LaTeX formatting replaced by svg macros from configuration
  file svg.m4 for font manipulation and special characters.

  The source files consist of the .m4 diagram sources and
  examplesDPV.htmx which is processed through m4 by the Makefile to
  produce examplesDPV.html.
