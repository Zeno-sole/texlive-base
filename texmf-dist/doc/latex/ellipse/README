This is the README file for the ellipse package.

VERSION

Version 1.0, December 2015

SUMMARY

Adds the ability to draw ellipses and elliptical arcs on top of the standard LaTeX2e picture environment. 

LaTeX has many advanced graphics packages now, the most extensive are tikz and
pstricks.  However, these are also large packages that take long to load and
may not always work on all drivers. The standard pict2e package removes many
of the previous limitations of the `old' LaTeX |picture| environment and makes
it a _lean and portable_ alternative to the more full featured packages.
However, even though it can draw circles and circle arcs well, it lacks the
ability to draw ellipses, ovals, and elliptical arcs. This package adds these
functions on top of the standard pict2e primitives  (i.e. the \cbezier command).
