kinematikz package by Vitor Santos (vitor@ua.pt)
Version 1.0 dated 21/Dec/2021

This package provides functionalities to draw kinematic diagrams 
for mechanisms using dedicate symbols (some inspired on the ISO standard and others). 
The intention is not to represent CAD mechanical drawings of mechanisms and
robots, but only to represent 2D and 3D kinematic chains. The package provides
links, joints and other symbols, mostly in the form of TikZ pic objects.
These pics can be placed in the canvas either by a central point for joints, 
and start and end points for some links.

The documentation consists of a PDF manual that describes the principles with the
syntax, examples and a reference listing of all the objects and their parameters.

The package is author-maintained.
