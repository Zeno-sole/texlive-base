This work consists of the files lroundrect.dtx and lroundrect.ins,
along with the generated files lroundrect.sty and lroundrect.pdf,
along with this README.

The lroundrect macros for LaTeX provide ways to use the
extremely configurable rounded rectangles of the |roundrect|
Metapost package with LaTeX.  It is chiefly useful for
examples, but also has macros for particular types of boxes
which are useful on their own.
