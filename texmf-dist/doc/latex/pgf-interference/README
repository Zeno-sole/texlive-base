The LaTeX package pgf-interference makes it possible to simulate interference
patterns occuring on a screen if monochromatic light is diffracted at regular
structures of slits. It makes use of the pgf/TikZ graphics package.

The package is still in an experimental stage. The user interface may change in
future versions.
