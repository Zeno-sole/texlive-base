This is pgf-spectra, version 2.1.2 (03/07/2021).

This package provides the \pgfspectra[<options>] command which draws continuous and emission or absorption spectra for 98 elements and their ions. It was developed mainly for the writing of my own documentation and exams sheets supporting directly PDF output format.
The drawing is made with the TikZ package and is based in the pst-spectra extension for PSTricks.
____________________________________________________________

*** v2.1.2 ***
Minor fix: wrong char encoding (pgf-spectra.sty, line:1555)
*** v2.1.1 ***
Major changes:
Small documentation enhancements.
Code rewrote for the command \pgfspectraplotshade.
New keys for \pgfspectraplotshade:
- shade begin
- logarithmic
*** v2.1.0 ***
The continuous visible region is now drawn via TikZ shading improving a little bit the speed of the whole process.
Minor fix: the width of the emission/absortion lines are now correctly drawn
New commands:
- \tempercolor (correlated color temperature, Kelvin to rgb color)
- \pgfspectrashade (for usage with TikZ package)
- \pgfspectraplotshade (for usage with PGFPLOTS package)
- \pgfspectraplotmap (for usage with PGFPLOTS package)
- \pgfspectrarainbow (draws a rainbow)
New keys for \pgfspectra:
- use visible shading
- backVIS
- axis unit
- axis unit precision
Keys for \pgfspectraplotshade:
- shade end
- shade opacity
- shade opacity color
Keys for \pgfspectrarainbow:
- rainbow fade
- rainbow start
- rainbow knock out
- rainbow background
- rainbow transparency
