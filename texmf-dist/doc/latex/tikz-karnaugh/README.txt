The tikz-karnaugh package is a LaTeX used to draw Karnaugh maps. It uses TikZ to produce high quality graph up to 12 variables, but this limit depends on the TeX memory usage and can be different for you. It is very good for presentation since TikZ allows for a better control over the final appearance of the map. You can control colour, styles and distances.

It can be considered an upgrade of Andreas W. Wieland's karnaugh package towards TikZ supporting. Also, complex maps with solution (prime implicants) pointed out can be generated with external java software. 

It supports both American and traditional styles, though American style requires a litter extra effort.
