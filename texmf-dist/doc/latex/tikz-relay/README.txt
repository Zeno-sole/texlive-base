This package contains a collection of symbols for typesetting electrical wiring diagrams for relay control systems. The symbols are meant to be in agreement with international standard IEC-60617 which is worldwide adopted with perhaps the exception of the USA. It extends and modifies when needed, the TikZ-library circuits.ee.IEC. A few non-standard symbols are also included mainly to be used in presentations, particularly with the beamer package.
