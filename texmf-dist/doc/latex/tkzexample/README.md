# tkzexample.sty — Package for the documentation of all tkz-* packages.

Release 1.45c 2022/07/14

## Note

This package is highly experimental and subject to change without notice. tkzexample is a package to present examples and their sources. It is essential if you want to compile the documentation of my packages like \tkzname{tkz-euclide}. I needed for my first packages to work in UTF8 and to present my sources in French. These sources had accents so I had to adapt the code used by \tkzimp{T.Tantau} to present the examples of \tkzname{pgfmanual}. There are still some imperfections so I invite you to improve this code if necessary
