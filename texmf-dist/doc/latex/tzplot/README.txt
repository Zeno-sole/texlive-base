tzplot.sty: Plot Graphs with TikZ Abbreviations
===============================================

Author: In-Sung Cho

Introduction:

This is a LaTeX package that provides TikZ based macros to make it easy to draw graphs.
The macros provided in the tzplot package are just abbreviations for TikZ codes, which can be complicated, but using the package, hopefully, makes drawing easier, especially when drawing repeatedly. The macros were chosen and developed with an emphasis on drawing graphs in economics.

Dependencies:

The package tzplot depends on the packages tikz, xparse, and expl3.
