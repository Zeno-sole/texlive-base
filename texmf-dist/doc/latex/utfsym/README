PACKAGE `utfsym'
========================================================================
The 'utfsym' package provides various symbols from the Unicode in order
to be able to use them originally in a school context such as on
worksheets. This could not be used so easily under LaTeX. The use in
other contexts is also possible. For this purpose, the symbols were
converted from the free font symbola.ttf by George Douros into the TikZ
format.

Each symbol can be embedded in documents in the desired size and color.
Only the hex code of the symbol must be specified.

The package was
originally part of the 'schule' package.

Version: 0.8.3

The package is still a work in progress. Open development steps are
shown in the documentation.
