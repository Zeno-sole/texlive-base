Worldflags is a package for drawing flags using TikZ.
Currently the national flags of all independent nations are included,
additionally the flags of the Austrian federal states, some other flags of
various regions and organizations and the nautical signal flags.

A flag can be drawn

- as a single TikZ-picture within ordinary text
- as a picture element within a TikZ-picture

The appearance of a flag (size, frame etc.) can be adapted using optional
parameters.

The description of every flag resides in a particular "flag description file".
