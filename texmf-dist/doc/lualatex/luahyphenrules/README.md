luahyphenrules
==============

Preloading hyphenation patterns (or “hyphen rules”) into the format is
not required in LuaTeX and recent releases of `babel` don't do it.
This package is addressed to those who just want to select the
language and load their patterns by means of `language.dat` without
loading `babel`.
