============================================================================

luaindex is another index processor written in Lua.  Currently usage of
LuaLaTeX is provided only, but plainLuaTeX, ConTeXt or other formats may 
follow.

luaindex provides more than one index.  Like SplitIndex it needs only one 
help file for all produced indexes.

============================================================================

Note: This is an alpha version!
For additional version information see `lualatex.dtx.'

============================================================================

To produce the package, the examples, and the manual from `luaindex.dtx'
you have to run

    lualatex --shell-escape luaindex.dtx

simply.

============================================================================

Distributors should save luaindex.lua as .../scripts/luaindex/luaindex.lua 
and luaindex.sty as .../tex/lualatex/luaindex/luaindex.sty at the TEXMF 
tree.

============================================================================

Important changes:

0.1b: - module name is not longer `koma.luaindex' but `luaindex' due to
        the usage of luatexbase-modutils

============================================================================
