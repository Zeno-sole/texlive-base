DESCRIPTION
    Scientific Knowledge Graph TeX (SciKgTeX) is a LuaLaTeX package which makes
    it possible to annotate specific research contributions in scientific documents.
    SciKGTeX will enrich the document by adding the marked contributions to PDF metadata
    in a structured XMP format which can be picked up by Search Engines and
    Knowledge Graphs.
