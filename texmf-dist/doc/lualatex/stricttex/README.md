stricttex --  strictly balanced brackets and numbers in command names
--------------------------------------

The stricttex package is a small, LuaLaTeX-only package providing you with
three, sometimes useful features:
	* It allows you to make brackets [...] ``strict'', meaning that
	each [ must be balanced by a ].
	* It allows you to use numbers in command names, so
	that you can do stuff like \newcommand\pi12{\pi_{12}}.
	* It allows you to use numbers \emph{and} primes in command names,
	so that you can do stuff like \newcommand\pi'12{\pi '_{12}}.
