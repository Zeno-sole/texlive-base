This is the README file for the Interpreter package.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
Date: June 2012.
Version: 1.2.

Interpreter preprocesses input files on the fly (no external program) and
manipulates input lines, e.g. to turn some markup into proper TeX syntax.
Interpreter doesn't work with ConTeXt.

LuaTeX is required, and the Lua side of the Gates package (i.e.  gates.lua),
version at least 0.2.

Relevant information can be found in interpreter-doc.pdf
or interpreter-doc.txt (source of the doc readable in a text editor).

The files in this distribution are:

interpreter.lua     - main code
interpreter.tex     - \input in plain TeX
interpreter.sty     - wrapper for LaTeX
interpreter-doc.tex - master file for the doc
interpreter-doc.txt - text of the doc
interpreter-doc.pdf - typeset doc
i-doc.lua           - interpretation for the doc (because, of course, the doc
                      is typeset with Interpreter)

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
