Version: 2022/1.1

SUMMARY

This package offers low-level mplib integration for plain LuaTeX and is 
designed with the purpose of being easy to extend.

The use of multiple simultaneous MetaPost instances is supported, as well as 
running TeX or lua code from within MetaPost. With the included minim-mp 
format file, you can even use LuaTeX as a stand-alone MetaPost compiler.

HISTORY

2022/1.1 (3/3/2022)

  New features:

    * Made instance initialisation more flexible; this replaces M.init_files 
      with M.init_code (see manual).
    * Add support for the glyph of operator.
    * Add support for the even-odd rule of filling and noncontinuous paths.
    * Add experimental latex support (the minim-lamp format).
    * Make minim-mp compatible with tikz/pgf.
    * Expand the plain macro set slightly.

  Minor changes:

    * Improved display of metapost logs.
    * Redefine units to fit other numerical engines better.
    * Fixed a bug in pattern generation that prevented simplifying patterns 
      into raw pdf code.
    * No longer write out superfluous line widths.
