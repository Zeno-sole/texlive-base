Version: 2021/1.0

SUMMARY

This package enables the inclusion of XMP (eXtensible Metadata Platform) data 
in the pdf output generated by (plain) LuaTeX. The use of XMP is required by 
PDF standards such as PDF/A.

In-line definition of new metadata schemas is supported, as well as setting 
and querying metadata values programmatically. For PDF/A documents, the 
necessary PDF/A extension schema definitions will be generated and included 
automatically.
