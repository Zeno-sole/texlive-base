Version: 2022/1.1

SUMMARY

This is a modern plain format for the LuaTeX engine, adding improved low-level 
support for many LuaTeX extensions and newer PDF features. While it can be 
used as drop-in replacement for plain TeX, it probably is most useful as 
a basis for your own formats.

Most features included in the format are provided by separate packages that 
can be used on their own; see the packages

    minim-mp      for mplib (MetaPost) support
    minim-math    for unicode mathematics
    minim-pdf     for creating Tagged PDF
    minim-xmp     for XMP (metadata) inclusion

This package proper only contains their shared lowest-level programming 
interface, together with their combined format.


DOCUMENTATION

In order to obtain the typeset manual of this package, simply say:

    luatex minim.doc

For the sake of completeness, this manual also includes the documentation of 
the packages mentioned above.


HISTORY

2022/1.1 (3/3/2022)

  Major changes:

    * Updated the allocation mechanism, distinguishing the new_<register>() 
      allocators from the new registernumber() function.
    * Included a new (pgf-compatible) pdf resource manager.

  Minor changes:

    * Updated the manual to reflect the latest versions of the other minims.
    * Included a few helper functions moved in from minim-pdf.
    * Fixed a bug where the primitive callback.register() could not remove 
      list callbacks (the module’s M.register() still cannot).
    * Added an M.deregister() function for callbacks.
    * Added a uselanguage callback.

2021/1.0 (1/6/2021)

  This was the original release.
