1. Introduction
 Molecular Coding Format(MCF) is new linear notation represent
 chemical structure diagrams.
 This Coding is named from programing technique
 such as operator, array, scope, macro, adressing, etc.
 mcf2graph convert from MCF to PNG, SVG, EPS, MOL file.
 It is also able to calculate molecular weight, exact mass, molecular formula.

3. How to use mcf2graph with MetaPost
 Minimum requirement to use mcf2graph : mpost.exe,mpost.dll,mpost.mp,plain.mp
 ( 1) >mpost               filename => output eps(.mps) file
 ( 2) >mpost -s ahangle=1  filename => output png file (600dpi)
 ( 3) >mpost -s ahangle=11 filename => output png file (1200dpi)
 ( 4) >mpost -s ahangle=2  filename => output svg file 
 ( 5) >mpost -s ahangle=3  filename => output eps(.eps) file
 ( 6) >mpost -s ahlength=1 filename => output information-aux file(for tex)
 ( 7) >mpost -s ahlength=2 filename => output information-aux file
                                               (for spread sheet)
 ( 8) >mpost -s ahlength=3 filename => output library-aux file
 ( 9) >mpost -s ahlength=5 filename => output mol file(V2000)
 (10) >mpost -s ahlength=6 filename => output mol file(V3000)
 (11) >mpost -s ahlength=7 filename => output report file
