TeXdraw distribution

$Id: README 2.8 2019/04/18 TeXdraw-v2r3 $

The TeXdraw package consists of a set of macro definitions for the TeX
typesetting program.  These macros allow the user to produce PostScript
drawings from within TeX and LaTeX.

The main benefits of TeXdraw accrue from the ability to produce drawings
from <within> TeX, using TeX fonts for labelling the drawing.

Basic drawing features include:
(1) moves, lines and arrow vectors
    - selectable gray level, line width, pattern, arrowhead size and type
(2) circles, ellipses, arcs, and Bezier curves
(3) general fill command to fill a region defined by lines and Bezier
    curves (selectable gray level)
(4) TeX text, including mathematics, can be positioned and superimposed
    on the drawing

TeXdraw has been designed to be extensible.  Drawing "segments" are
relocatable, self-contained units.  Using a combination of the begingroup/
endgroup mechanism in TeX and the gsave/grestore mechanism in PostScript,
drawing segments allow for local changes to the scaling and line
parameters.  Using TeX's macro definition capability, new drawing commands
can be constructed from drawing segments.

The extensibility features include,
(1) relocatable drawing segments to keep changes local
(2) local segment scaling
(3) saving and restoring positions using symbolic positions

auxiliary macros, and the TeXdraw manual (PosScript/PDF).

TeXdraw documentation (directory manual/):

===============================================
Initial Tests:

(1) View the PostScript or pdf version of the manual ("texdraw.ps" or
    "texdraw.pdf") to see the capabilities of TeXdraw.
(2) Try TeX'ing the examples file.  Assuming plain TeX is invoked with the
    command "tex" and LaTeX2e is invoked with the command "latex"
    % tex txdexamp
    ... or ...
    % latex texdexamp.latex
(3) Printing the examples using the appropriate printer driver program
    (only dvips can be used with the plain TeX version of the examples),
    % dvips txdexamp
