== NAME

tikztosvg - Render TikZ diagrams to SVG.

== SYNOPSIS

*tikztosvg* [_OPTION_]... _INPUT_PATH_

== DESCRIPTION

The tikztosvg(1) command renders TikZ diagrams to SVG.

If _INPUT_PATH_ is set to _-_ the input will be read from stdin.

== OPTIONS

*-o, --output*=_OUTPUT_PATH_::
  Write output to file _OUTPUT_PATH_.
  If set to _-_ the output will be written to stdout.
  Defaults to the base name of the input file suffixed with the _.svg_ 
  extension. The file is resolved relative to the working directory.

*-p, --package*=+_PACKAGE_::
  Include _\usepackage{PACKAGE}_ when rendering the diagram. The tikz, tikz-cd,
  pgfplots, amsmath and amssymb packages are always included by default.

*-l, --library*=+_LIBRARY::
  Include _\usetikzlibrary{LIBRARY}_ when rendering the diagram.

*-q, --quiet*::
  Silence application log messages and script warnings.

*--lualatex*::
  Use LuaTeX as the TeX engine. LuaTeX is already the
  default, so this option doesn't really do much.

*--xelatex*::
  Use XeTeX as the TeX engine.

*--pdflatex*::
  Use pdfTeX as the TeX engine.

*-h, --help*::
  Print a help message.

*-v, --version*::
  Prints version information.

== ENVIRONMENT

*tikztosvg* requires XeTeX and pdf2svg to be installed. Make sure 
any additional LaTeX packages are installed before using them in a diagram.

== EXIT STATUS

*0*::
  Success.

*1*::
  Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error).

*[n]*::
  Failure (document processing failure).
